# Weather forecast application with Open API and Node.js

This is a Node.js application for weather forecast. It is using "OpenWeatherMap" API to fetch weather information for different cities.

## Usage

Click [here](https://nenalukic.github.io/api-weather-project/) to view the application in GitHub pages. Unfortunately it does not work to call the API from GitHub pages, but you can try to run it locally.

## Installation
Register at ["Open Weather Map"](https://openweathermap.org/) to get an API key.
Put a key in ".env" file in app directory and name it "MYAPIKEY".
 
While in application directory, to run the applicatin open a terminal and type:
```
nodemon
```
Then open a browser and type:
```
localhost:3000
```
Then enter a city name for which you want to get a weather forecast.
